🏥 Medical Data History Analysis using SQL
📖 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing medical patient history data using SQL to extract meaningful insights related to patient demographics, BMI classification, weight groups, and health conditions. The analysis helps in understanding health trends and identifying risk categories within the dataset.

🎯 Problem Statement

Healthcare datasets often contain large volumes of patient information that are difficult to interpret without structured analysis.
The goal of this project is to:

Categorize patients based on BMI and weight ranges

Identify obesity and health risk groups

Generate summarized insights using SQL queries

📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains anonymized medical history records, including:

Patient ID

Age

Gender

Height & Weight

BMI values

Health indicators

(Dataset used for learning and analytical purposes only)

🛠 Tools & Technologies

SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQL Server – mention what you used)

GitHub for version control

🔍 Key Analysis Performed

Grouped patients into weight ranges (e.g., 100–109, 110–119, etc.)

Calculated BMI using height and weight

Classified patients into BMI categories:

Underweight

Normal

Overweight

Obese

Counted patients per health category

Sorted and aggregated patient data for trend analysis

🧠 SQL Concepts Used

CASE WHEN statements for BMI classification

Aggregate functions (COUNT, AVG, SUM)

GROUP BY and ORDER BY

Subqueries

Conditional logic

Data filtering using WHERE clauses

📈 Key Insights

A significant portion of patients fall into the Overweight and Obese categories

BMI-based classification helps identify high-risk patient groups

Weight grouping provides better segmentation for healthcare analysis
